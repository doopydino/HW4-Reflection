# HW4 - Reflection
Over the past two milestones, you've had the opportunity to apply several software engineering practices and processes in the design and implementation of a bot project.
## Design
1. What was most helpful about thinking about design methods of your project?

The most helpful aspect about thinking about the design of our project is that everyone on the team was able to envision the same final product and everyone was on the same page about all of our ideas. As mentioned in our PROCESS.md file, we did a lot of group and pair programming. The fact that we had already considered and agreed upon the design of our bot made it much easier to work together towards a common goal.

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

The most difficult part of the design process was being able to think ahead for any problems that may arise that would make us want to change the design of our bot. This made us have to make some adjustments as we began programming in order to circumvent these issues. With our new experience, we should be able to predict and avoid any potential problems before we finish the design process.

3. What design methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?

For a project like our own, I found the storyboard to be the most helpful. Our project is very user-focused, where the bot can have a lot of unique interactions between users. This makes it very important to consider any possible interactions that users may want to have with the bot when designing it. While use cases cover this territory, storyboards are especially nice because it can be extremely helpful to visualize how the interaction will take place rather than only explain it through words. 
## Implementation
1. What was most helpful about implementing, testing, and integration in your bot project?

The fact that we were implementing our bot on Discord made this process go very smoothly. Discord has very thorough documentation that can help developers achieve essentially anything they want their bot to do, and there are also a lot of developer-side videos and forums that can answer any questions. It was also very easy to add our bot to a Discord server, and update it any time we wanted to test something.

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

I think the most difficult part of implementation was trying to cover all of the possible edge cases. As soon as we thought we had everything covered, a team member would think of another possible way a user could "break" the bot, or interact with it in a way that it wouldn't know how to handle. As we learned, some users will look for any cracks or weaknesses in a bot and try to exploit it as much as possible, so we have to be extremely thorough in handling all cases.

3. What implementation, testing, and integration methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?

I would definitely be interested in making more Discord bots in the future, either for projects or just in my free time. It seems like Discord really can support any sort of bot you can imagine, so I think it would be cool to whip up some other bots just for fun. Maybe some more game bots to enjoy with friends, or perhaps some productivity bots to help me out.
## Process
1. What was most helpful about implementing Kanban and code review in your project?

Kanban boards (or, at least, our version of them) are very helpful for working in a group setting because it allows everyone to organize ideas and tasks and make sure everyone is on the same page. In our case, we would discuss and take note of tasks that needed to be completed, but without an official Kanban board. Code review also looked a little different in our group. As mentioned previously, we did a lot of group and pair programming, so code review essentially happened as the code was being written. Both elements were very helpful for keeping the group focused on the same goals and ensuring everything was completed timely and successfully.

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

The most difficult part of the software engineering process that we employed is trying to get all group members together at a single time. Of course, the entire group consists of busy college students with wildly different schedules, from academics to extracurriculars. It's hard to find a time that works for everyone, which is where I think the Kanban boards can be especially helpful because it allows people to work and make updates asynchronously. In the future, I may try to use this feature more than trying to get everyone together at once.

3. What software processes or practices might you want to try again in the future on another project?

I would definitely want to try pair programming on more projects in the future. It seemed to ease the pain of getting stuck on a particular issue and not knowing how to solve it. A lot of times when programming individually, I will make a silly mistake like forgetting a character somewhere, or I will simply be stuck looking at a problem from one perspective when there's a completely different perspective that would be much easier. In these cases, it can take hours to fix the problem individually, but having a second person with a second set of eyes and a different way of thinking can make the problem seemingly negligible.
## Overall
Considering all the design methods, implementation practices, and software processes you've encountered---compare and contrast how the benefits of the different practices and how they might be useful together.

As mentioned earlier, I liked how the design methods that were used allowed the team to get on the same page. I found the storyboard especially useful, as it provided both a logical and visual idea of how the design of a particular feature or interaction would look. In contrast, use cases covered these elements similarly, but without the visual aspect, which I found very helpful when it came to implementation. Speaking of implementation, I thought code review is an essential protocol to prevent bad code from being committed. That being said, it is important for each programmer to properly comment their code, or else their intention can get lost and code review will be extremely difficult for the reviewer. Moreover, I found that Kanban boards can be extremely useful in team project settings (as described earlier), and can be used in conjunction with pair programming. Instead of assigning a task to one programmer, assign it to a pair and have them work together on that task. That being said, I think pair programming is infinitely better than group programming, which I also partook in this semester. With pair programming, you have a second person to bounce ideas off of and to help with resolving any issues. But in group programming, I found that the person coding was often just getting thrown suggestions from several people at once and almost acting like a puppet rather than a partner. It's like the metaphor of there being too many cooks in the kitchen.
